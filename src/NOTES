Indexing Methods
================
There are several methods of indexing the contents of files,
with the most commonly used being i-nodes and File Allocation Tables.

inodes
------
Each file is made of data blocks, index blocks, and one inode block.
Inodes are a natural place to store Metadata such as file size, owner,
creation/access/modification times, locks, etc.

FAT
---
There are several variants on FAT, but the general design is to have a table,
(actually a pair of tables, one serving as a backup for the first in case it is corrupted)
which holds a list of blocks of a given size, which map to the whole capacity of the disk. 


Workings of File Systems
========================
There are several common approaches to storing disk information.
However, in comparison to memory management,
there are some key differences in managing disk media:

-  Data can only be written in fixed size chunks.
-  Access times are different for different locations on the disk.
   Seeking is usually a costly operation..
-  Data throughput is very small compared to RAM.
-  Data commonly has to be maintained.

Hence some file systems have specialized structures, algorithms,
or combinations thereof to improve speed ratings.
